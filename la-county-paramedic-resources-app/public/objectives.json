            "question": "Definition of Most Accessible Receiving Facility (MAR):",
            "answer": "MAR is the facility that is most easily reached for a patient, but not necessarily the closest one. Transport decisions should factor in traffic, weather, and other conditions affecting travel time. The MAR could also be a facility associated with the patient's health plan or their 'medical home,' based on their specific medical needs and history."

            "question": "When is bypassing the Most Accessible Receiving Facility (MAR) appropriate?",
            "answer": "Bypassing the MAR is appropriate under several conditions:\n1. Base Hospital Decision: Another facility is deemed more suitable for the patient's needs.\n2. Specialty Care Needs: The patient requires care at a specialty center such as a Trauma Center, Pediatric Trauma Center, ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction Center, etc.\n3. Patient's Hospital Request: Conditions include if the patient's condition can withstand the extra transport time, the chosen hospital isn't limited to a specific service area, the hospital can address the patient's main complaint, the transport won't significantly impact the EMS unit's primary response area, and if the request can't be met and the patient refuses transport, try to arrange alternative transportation (e.g., private ambulance).\n4. MAR Diversion for ALS Patients: If the MAR requests diversion and the patient doesn’t have critical issues like an unmanageable airway or uncontrolled hemorrhage, an alternative facility is reachable within 15 minutes, Code 3. If not, patients should go to the MAR unless there's an internal disaster."
